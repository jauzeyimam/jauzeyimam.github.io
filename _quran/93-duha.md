### Context

When studying the Quran there's two aspects to note:

1. Immediate need for that revelation in the time of the Prophet (SAW) 
2. Future application of those verses.  

Revelation, wahi, was a rare event even in the life of the Prophet, however the desire for wahi in the Prophet was so intense such that when the connection of wahi is lost than the Prophet felt incredible anxiety.  Couple this built-in wahi based anxiety with the tremendous external pressure the Prophet was facing with respect to revelation from the people of Mecca.  And couple to *that* the fear that the Prophet had displeased his lord and had therefore been forsaken.

### Verse 1-3

The first thing God does is remove the immediate and most major concern of the Prophet (SAW): that of being forsaken.  God does this by first swearing upon two of his creations, the night and the day.  They are also specifically universal creations, meaning that they are true for all times and all peoples.  Additionally the night and the day, beyond covering the full expanse of that subject, are simultaneously contrasting and complimentary—something that when understood in the grand plan of Allah are ideas and entities that occupy their purpose and niche beyond the understanding of people.  This latter point, beyond the understanding of people, is a message to the Prophet (SAW) that the revelation coming and not coming do not have a bearing on whether the Prophet is forsaken or not, but rather part of His grand plan.  Both what we understand as "good" and "bad" (ie what we like and what we don't like) are, in the larger plan, tests from God—they are not objectively good and bad things, only to our limited perspective.  In that light, the drought of revelation, a bad time for the Prophet (SAW) meant something different in the objective, or grand plan, sense.  We need to begin looking beyond our perspective to the grand plan and universal sense of why things happen the way they do.

### Verse 4

The Surah then continues with another contrast; the literal verse reads "And the last shall be better for thee than the first." The first, this world, is seemingly of utmost importance to us *now* in our limited perspective, yet "the last" is what's ultimately the most important *for* us.  This is true for the life of the Prophet (SAW) where the beginning of his life, the first, was very different from his time as a Messenger toward the latter end of his life.  Also it's true for the different periods of Revelation itself, from during the time of Mecca at the first until the time of Medina at the end.  From poverty and oppression and the worst of all things to, in Medina, the rulership, not only to the Muslims, but to all the Medinians.  However it's finally true for the case of this life versus the Hereafter, the most common interpretation of this ayah.  Nobody can forecast the future, yet the Quran notes that the Last is better than the First (almost like a Quranic version of "This too shall pass" but far more optimistic).  What's even more interesting is the audience of this, quite literally, ultimately optimistic verse—those who are seeking the Quran's guidance.  Indicating the ultimate mercy of Allah (swt) this is fundamentally a prophecy upon those seeking guidance from this verse.  That's incredible.

### Context

Related Ayat: 16:97, 19:85, 90:11

### Verses 1-3

The Quran's way is that it always tries to show contrast in order for us to understand the scope of Creation. To reinforce the contrasts and frame the Surah by them, Allah (SWT) takes oaths—all of which begin by "And..."; there are four things mentioned here, and all four are His creations. The night, the day, the male and the female. This affirms the conviction for which the next thing sworn by is proven. You swear by X to prove the truth about Y. Over here, Allah (SWT) swears by these things that nobody can claim to have created except for him.  

First, the contrast between night and day. This contrast is not just done for the good of it—there's a reason it's done. The contrast of night and day are mentioned in a way that notes that they are not better than the other—night is not better than day, nor day than night. The same is true for man and woman. Rather, each has a purpose defined by God.

### Verse 4

Just as there is a scope between night and day, there is also a diversity between the ends of all people—to either go to heaven or hell. How you live your life, all the endeavors that you're working toward, are still ultimately geared toward Heaven or Hell.

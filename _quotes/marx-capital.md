### CHAPTER 1: THE COMMODITY

#### The Two Factors of the Commodity: Use Value and Value (Substance of Value, Magnitude of Value)

>“The commodity is, first of all, an external object, a thing which through its qualities satisfies human needs of whatever kind.”

>Every useful thing, for example, iron, paper, etc., may be looked at from the two points of view of quality and quantity. Every useful thing is a whole composed of many properties; it can therefore be useful in various ways. The discovery of these ways and hence of the manifold uses of things is the work of history.

>“The usefulness of a thing makes it a use-value.”

>“It [the usefulness of a thing] is conditioned by the physical properties of the commodity, and has no existence apart from the latter.”

>“This property of a commodity is independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities.”

>The use-values of commodities provide the material for a special branch of knowledge, namely the commercial knowledge of commodities.

>“Exchange-value appears first of all as the quantitative relation, the proportion, in which use-value of one kind exchange for use-values of another kind. This relation changes constantly with time and place. Hence exchange-value that is inseparably connected with the commodity, inherent in it, seems a contradiction in terms. Let us consider the matter more closely.”

126

>the valid exchange-values of a particular commodity express something equal, and secondly, exchange-value cannot be anything other than the mode of expression, the ‘form of appearance’, of a content distinguishable from it.

>a common element of identical magnitude exists in two different things, in 1 quarter of corn and similarly in x cwt of iron. Both are therefore equal to a third thing, which in itself is neither the one nor the other. Each of them, so far as it is exchange-value, must therefore be reducible to this third thing.

>the exchange values of commodities must be reduced to a common element, of which they represent a greater or a lesser quantity.

>Within the exchange relation, one use-value is worth just as much as another, provided only that it is present in the appropriate quantity.
